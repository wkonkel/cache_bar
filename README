Preface
=======

This is a project that is currently used in production environments but isn't "production ready" unless
you're adventurous.  Consider this as a "sneak peak" rather than a "first release".


CacheBar
========

CacheBar is a pure ruby implementation of memcached client protocol.  Several things to note:

1. unlike default memcached behavior, incr/decr will automatically and safely create the underlying
   key if it doesn't already exist.  this saves you a step of creating the key if it doesn't exist.
2. gzip is supported by passing in :gzip => true into options of any setting function.
3. strings and integers are stored natively in memcached (allowing incr/decr/prepend/append to
   work). everything else is serialized using ruby Marshal dump/load.
4. default ttl is 0, meaning never expire
